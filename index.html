          <p>The event, Innovations for a Better Tomorrow, was conceived by the organizers of Excel  based on the conviction that a simple idea may give rise to a path-breaking development. We believe that as students, as engineers and as citizens of the nation, we have a responsibility to give back to society and to use our knowledge and expertise to propel India to new heights. Through IBeTo, innovations and ideas from individuals are brought to the forefront, thoroughly developed and fabricated into products that will have a direct impact on the lives of people. IBeTo hopes to contribute positively to the growth of our nation, setting the stage for sustainable and inclusive development.</p>
